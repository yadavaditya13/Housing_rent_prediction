# Housing_rent_prediction
Using brazzilian_houses_on_rent dataset, i trained various models by processing the dataset first and the finding correlation and displaying the accuracy of prediction. (P.S:. Made it for fun). Also used pytorch for creating a neural network model to train using this dataset and displayed the accuracy by testing (had help with this... just wanted to explore pytorch).
